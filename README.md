#  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Useless UI ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Useless UI is a Jetpack Compose library containing fun, but probably useless UI components. My goal is for each component module to be available as an independent Gradle dependency and also as a suite that can be imported as one dependency. This repo also contains a sample app to showcase these components.

I will be adding to this over time as I get inspiration, tinker with things, and create components I want to reuse in other side projects.

## Components

### ShatterableLayout

This component allows its children to be shattered into many pieces. The exact properties of this shattering are configurable via `ShatterSpec`. `ShatterableLayout` captures a bitmap of its content (the timing of this can be controlled via `CaptureMode`) and then uses that for the shattering effect. The shattering is done using a Voronoi Diagram algorithm to create non-overlapping random polygons. I was inspired by the glass shattering transition in Powerpoint, which I recall fondly adding to all of my presentations despite being completely unnecessary and annoying.

You can also do this in reverse if you want to "unshatter" something which looks neat.

#### Installation
[![](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.seankenkeremath/shatterable-layout)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.github.seankenkeremath/shatterable-layout)

```
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.seankenkeremath:shatterable-layout:0.1.0") // Replace with latest version above
}
```

#### Usage

##### ShatterableLayout

```kotlin
// Basic usage
ShatterableLayout(
    progress = shatterProgress, // 0f = intact, 1f = fully shattered
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()
) {
    // Your content here
    Text("Example content")
}

// With more options
ShatterableLayout(
    progress = shatterProgress,
    captureMode = CaptureMode.LAZY,
    shatterSpec = ShatterSpec(shardCount = 30, velocity = 300f), // ShatterSpec defines the properties of the shattering effect. There are many other parameters, but default values will be applied if not specified.
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()
) {
    // Your content here
}
```

##### ShatterPager

```kotlin
// Basic usage
ShatterPager(
    state = pagerState,
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()
) { page ->
    // Your page content here
    Box(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
        Text("Page $page")
    }
}

// With custom shatter effect
ShatterPager(
    state = pagerState,
    shatterSpec = ShatterSpec(shardCount = 20),
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()
) { page ->
    // Your page content here
}
```

#### Key Classes and Functions

##### ShatterSpec
Configures the shatter effect properties:
```kotlin
ShatterSpec(
    shardCount: Int = 15,
    easing: Easing = FastOutSlowInEasing,
    velocity: Float = 300f,
    rotationXTarget: Float = 30f,
    rotationYTarget: Float = 30f,
    rotationZTarget: Float = 30f,
    velocityVariation: Float = 100f,
    rotationXVariation: Float = 10f,
    rotationYVariation: Float = 10f,
    rotationZVariation: Float = 10f,
    alphaTarget: Float = 0f,
)
```

##### CaptureMode
Controls when the underlying bitmap is captured for the shatter effect:
- `CaptureMode.AUTO`: Automatically recaptures when content changes based on size or the `contentKey` param for `ShatterableLayout` 
- `CaptureMode.LAZY`: Only captures once shatter progress is > 0. This can be more memory efficient depending on your use case.

#### Optimizations
* Individual shards are rendered using cropped, smaller bitmaps to conserve memory
* Bitmap capturing can be done lazily or immediately depending on your use case
* The shattering animation of individual shards are performed at the graphics layer
* Recompositions are minimized

#### Future improvements + optimizations
* We can avoid creating cropped bitmaps entirely if Compose supports either **1)** `graphicsLayer` animations on Canvas objects (we can crop the parent bitmap in the Canvas) or **2)** cropping inside `graphicsLayer` with an arbitrary path (only simple shapes are currently supported)
* Capturing of the bitmap and creation of Voronoi cells can be offloaded to a background thread

### Wavy Components

Note: In these screenshots the "jump" is just coming from the GIF repeating. 
These components are designed to seamlessly repeat the wave pattern.

These components give you the building block to create wavy effects in your UI. 
That includes a normal `WavyLine` as well as a `WavyBox` where any combination of sides can be wavy. 
The waves are customizable via `WavySpec` which can easily be animated or controlled by the parent Composable.
`WavyBox` supports several draw styles including via `Brush` or Color.

This library also includes a `wavyPathSegment` function you can use in Path to draw a wave between 2 points for your own custom UI.

#### Installation
[![](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.seankenkeremath/waves)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.github.seankenkeremath/waves)

```
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.seankenkeremath:waves:0.1.1") // Replace with latest version above
}
```

#### Usage

##### WavyLine

```kotlin
// Basic usage with animation managed by the component
WavyLine(
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .height(50.dp),
    crestHeight = 8.dp,
    waveLength = 60.dp,
    color = Color.Blue,
    strokeWidth = 2.dp
)

// With animation state-hoisted to allow control from the parent
val animationProgress = remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }
WavyLine(
    progress = animationProgress.value,
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .height(50.dp),
    crestHeight = 8.dp,
    waveLength = 60.dp,
    color = Color.Red,
    strokeWidth = 2.dp,
    centerWave = true
)
```

##### WavyBox

```kotlin
// Basic usage with animation managed by the component
WavyBox(
    spec = WavyBoxSpec(
        topWavy = true,
        bottomWavy = true,
        leftWavy = false,
        rightWavy = false,
        crestHeight = 6.dp
    ),
    style = WavyBoxStyle.Outlined(
        strokeColor = Color.Black,
        strokeWidth = 2.dp
    ),
    modifier = Modifier.size(200.dp)
) {
    Text("Wavy Box")
}

// With animation state-hoisted to allow control from the parent
val animationProgress = remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }
WavyBox(
    progress = animationProgress.value,
    spec = WavyBoxSpec(
        topWavy = true,
        bottomWavy = true,
        leftWavy = false,
        rightWavy = false
    ),
    style = WavyBoxStyle.FilledWithColor(
        color = Color.Cyan,
        strokeWidth = 0.dp,
        strokeColor = Color.Transparent
    ),
    modifier = Modifier.size(200.dp)
)
```

##### DistortionBox

```kotlin
// Basic usage with animation managed by the component
DistortionBox(
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .height(200.dp)
) {
    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .background(MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primaryContainer)
    ) {
        Text(
            "Distorted Content",
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineMedium,
            color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.onPrimaryContainer,
            modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.Center)
        )
    }
}

// With animation state-hoisted to allow control from the parent
val time = remember { mutableFloatStateOf(0f) }
DistortionBoxImpl(
    time = time.value,
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .height(200.dp)
) {
    // Your content here
}
```

Note: The `DistortionBox` component requires Android 13 (API 33/Tiramisu) or higher to work as it uses RuntimeShader. The component applies a wave distortion effect to its content using a custom shader.

##### Custom Path with Wavy Segment

```kotlin
// Add a wavy segment to a path
Path().apply {
    moveTo(startX, startY)
    wavyPathSegment(
        animationProgress = animatedPhase,
        crestHeightPx = 20f,
        waveLengthPx = 100f,
        startPoint = Offset(startX, startY),
        endPoint = Offset(endX, endY)
    )
}
```

#### Key Classes and Functions

##### wavyPathSegment
Creates a wavy path between two points:
```kotlin
// Basic usage
wavyPathSegment(
    animationProgress = 0f,
    crestHeightPx = 10f,
    waveLengthPx = 50f,
    startPoint = Offset(0f, 0f),
    endPoint = Offset(100f, 0f)
)

// With Dp values
wavyPathSegment(
    animationProgress = 0f,
    crestHeight = 10.dp,
    waveLength = 50.dp,
    startPoint = Offset(0f, 0f),
    endPoint = Offset(100f, 0f),
    density = LocalDensity.current
)
```

#### Future improvements + optimizations
* I plan to build in support for a corner radius which will make the corners for wavy box look a bit cleaner as separate wave segments converge
