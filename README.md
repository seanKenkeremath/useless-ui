#  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Useless UI ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Useless UI is a Jetpack Compose library containing fun, but probably useless UI components. My goal is for each component module to be available as an independent Gradle dependency and also as a suite that can be imported as one dependency. This repo also contains a sample app to showcase these components.

I will be adding to this over time as I get inspiration, tinker with things, and create components I want to reuse in other side projects.

## Components

### ShatterableLayout

This component allows its children to be shattered into many pieces. The exact properties of this shattering are configurable via `ShatterSpec`. `ShatterableLayout` captures a bitmap of its content (the timing of this can be controlled via `CaptureMode`) and then uses that for the shattering effect. The shattering is done using a Voronoi Diagram algorithm to create non-overlapping random polygons. I was inspired by the glass shattering transition in Powerpoint, which I recall fondly adding to all of my presentations despite being completely unnecessary and annoying.

You can also do this in reverse if you want to "unshatter" something which looks neat.

#### Installation
[![](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.seankenkeremath/shatterable-layout)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.github.seankenkeremath/shatterable-layout)

```
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.seankenkeremath:shatterable-layout:0.1.0") // Replace with latest version above
}
```

#### Optimizations
* Individual shards are rendered using cropped, smaller bitmaps to conserve memory
* Bitmap capturing can be done lazily or immediately depending on your use case
* The shattering animation of individual shards are performed at the graphics layer
* Recompositions are minimized

#### Future improvements + optimizations
* We can avoid creating cropped bitmaps entirely if Compose supports either **1)** `graphicsLayer` animations on Canvas objects (we can crop the parent bitmap in the Canvas) or **2)** cropping inside `graphicsLayer` with an arbitrary path (only simple shapes are currently supported)
* Capturing of the bitmap and creation of Voronoi cells can be offloaded to a background thread

### Wavy Components

Note: In these screenshots the "jump" is just coming from the GIF repeating. 
These components are designed to seamlessly repeat the wave pattern.

These components give you the building block to create wavy effects in your UI. 
That includes a normal `WavyLine` as well as a `WavyBox` where any combination of sides can be wavy. 
The waves are customizable via `WavySpec` which can easily be animated or controlled by the parent Composable.
`WavyBox` supports several draw styles including via `Brush` or Color.

This library also includes a `wavyPathSegment` function you can use in Path to draw a wave between 2 points for your own custom UI.

#### Installation
[![](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.seankenkeremath/waves)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.github.seankenkeremath/waves)

```
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.seankenkeremath:waves:0.1.0") // Replace with latest version above
}
```

#### Future improvements + optimizations
* I plan to build in support for a corner radius which will make the corners for wavy box look a bit cleaner as separate wave segments converge
